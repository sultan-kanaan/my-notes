 ## Here are the key points that every developer must master : ##
 -  The Purpose of Software (to help pepole)
 -  The Goals of Software Design
   1. Your design should be easy for you
   2. helpful for others
- (Mis)understanding (Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer)
- Simplicity (Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does)
- Complexity (Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it)
- Maintenance (t is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation)
- Consistency (If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place)
- Prioritizing 
 1. The desirability of a change
 2. The value of a change
 3. The effort required to perform the change
 -  Solving Problems 
 1. understanding
 2. planning
 3. ividing
 - Good enough is fine (Start small, improve it, then extend)
 - Predictions (Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now) 
 - Assumptions (Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future)
 - Don’t reinvent the wheel.
 - Resistance (As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’)
 - Automation (If you can automate it, automate it)
 - Code measurement (The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read)
 - Productivity
 - Testing (Untested code is the code that doesn’t work)
 - (Under)Estimation (Everything takes longer than you think)
 - Running Away From Rewriting
 - Documentation and Commenting
 -  Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)
 - Self-Development
 - Don’t be a hero
 - Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help
